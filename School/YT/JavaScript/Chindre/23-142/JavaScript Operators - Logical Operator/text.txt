Logical operators in JavaScript are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values or expressions. They allow you to combine or manipulate Boolean values and make decisions based on the results. JavaScript has three logical operators: AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!). Here's a breakdown of each logical operator:

1. Logical AND (&&):
   - Syntax: `operand1 && operand2`
   - Description: Returns `true` if both `operand1` and `operand2` are `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This operator evaluates both operands and short-circuits if the first operand is `false`.

2. Logical OR (||):
   - Syntax: `operand1 || operand2`
   - Description: Returns `true` if either `operand1` or `operand2` (or both) is `true`. It returns `false` only if both operands are `false`. Similar to the logical AND operator, this operator also short-circuits if the first operand is `true`.

3. Logical NOT (!):
   - Syntax: `!operand`
   - Description: Returns the inverse Boolean value of the operand. If the operand is `true`, the result will be `false`. If the operand is `false`, the result will be `true`. It essentially flips the truth value of the operand.

Logical operators are often used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. They can also be used to combine multiple conditions to create more complex logical expressions.

Here are some important rules to keep in mind when working with logical operators:

- The logical AND operator (`&&`) has higher precedence than the logical OR operator (`||`).
- The logical NOT operator (`!`) has the highest precedence.
- Short-circuiting: The logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`) operators evaluate operands from left to right and stop evaluating as soon as the result is determined. This can be useful for improving performance or avoiding errors in certain scenarios.

It's important to note that logical operators can work with values other than Booleans. In JavaScript, truthy and falsy values are treated as `true` and `false`, respectively, in logical operations.

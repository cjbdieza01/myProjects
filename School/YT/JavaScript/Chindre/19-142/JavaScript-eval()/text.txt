In JavaScript, the `eval()` function is a built-in function that evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and executes it. It takes a string argument containing JavaScript code and executes that code within the current execution context.

When `eval()` is called, it treats the input string as JavaScript code and executes it dynamically at runtime. The resulting value of the evaluated code is returned by `eval()`. The code can include variable declarations, function definitions, expressions, statements, and other valid JavaScript syntax.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of `eval()`:

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var code = "x + y"; // JavaScript code as a string
var result = eval(code); // Evaluating the code

console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

In the above example, the `eval()` function takes the string `"x + y"`, which represents a JavaScript expression, and evaluates it within the current scope. Since `x` is assigned the value of 5 and `y` is assigned the value of 10, the evaluated expression results in 15.

It's important to note that the use of `eval()` should be approached with caution due to potential security risks and performance implications. Executing arbitrary code with `eval()` can introduce vulnerabilities, as it allows execution of any JavaScript code passed as a string, including potentially malicious code. Additionally, using `eval()` can hinder performance optimizations by the JavaScript engine, as it inhibits static analysis and compilation of the code.

Therefore, it is generally recommended to use alternative approaches whenever possible, such as using functions, closures, or other appropriate constructs, rather than relying on `eval()`.

Here's an overview of JavaScript variables and constants:

**Variables**:
Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. They are named containers that hold values of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, or functions. To use a variable, you need to declare it using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword, followed by the variable name. Here's an example:

```javascript
var age; // Declaration of a variable named "age"
age = 25; // Assignment of a value to the "age" variable
```

In the example above, the variable named "age" is declared using the `var` keyword and assigned the value `25` later. JavaScript allows you to update the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it.

Variables declared with the `var` keyword have function scope or global scope, depending on where they are declared. However, it's recommended to use `let` or `const` for block-scoped variables in modern JavaScript.

**Constants**:
Constants are similar to variables, but their values cannot be changed once assigned. They provide a way to define values that should remain constant throughout the execution of a program. Constants are declared using the `const` keyword, followed by the constant name and the initial value. Here's an example:

```javascript
const PI = 3.14; // Declaration of a constant named "PI" with the value 3.14
```

In the example above, the constant named "PI" is declared using the `const` keyword and assigned the value `3.14`. Attempting to reassign a value to a constant will result in an error.

It's good practice to use constants when you have values that should not be changed during the execution of your program, such as mathematical constants, configuration values, or fixed values.

Variables and constants are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript that allow you to store, manipulate, and retrieve data as your program executes. They play a crucial role in dynamic programming and enable you to create flexible and interactive applications.

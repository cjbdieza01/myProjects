`innerText` and `innerHTML` are both properties in JavaScript used to manipulate the content of HTML elements, but they serve different purposes:

1. **innerText**:
   - `innerText` is used to get or set the text content of an HTML element, excluding any HTML tags or elements within that element. It deals with the textual content only.
   - It's mainly used when you want to work with the text within an element and do not want to include any HTML tags or interpret them as markup.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Get the text content of an element
   var element = document.getElementById("example");
   var textContent = element.innerText;

   // Set the text content of an element
   element.innerText = "New text content";
   ```

2. **innerHTML**:
   - `innerHTML` is used to get or set the HTML content of an HTML element, including any HTML tags and elements within that element. It allows you to work with the entire content, including markup.
   - It can be used when you want to insert or modify HTML content within an element, including adding new elements or complex structures.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   // Get the HTML content of an element
   var element = document.getElementById("example");
   var htmlContent = element.innerHTML;

   // Set the HTML content of an element
   element.innerHTML = "<p>New <em>HTML</em> content</p>";
   ```

In summary, `innerText` is focused on working with plain text content within an element, while `innerHTML` allows you to work with the entire HTML content, including HTML tags and elements. When using `innerHTML`, be cautious of potential security risks like cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if you are inserting user-generated or untrusted content into the HTML.

Certainly! A factorial is a mathematical operation denoted by the exclamation mark (!) and is used to calculate the product of all positive integers from 1 to a given number. For example, the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!, is calculated as:

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

In JavaScript, you can calculate the factorial of a number using a function. Let's go through the step-by-step process of creating a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number:

1. Define a JavaScript function:

   First, you need to define a JavaScript function that takes an input parameter (the number for which you want to calculate the factorial) and returns the factorial as the result.

   ```javascript
   function calculateFactorial(number) {
       // Function logic will go here
   }
   ```

2. Handle the base case:

   The factorial of 0 and 1 is 1 by definition. So, you should handle these base cases by returning 1 immediately.

   ```javascript
   function calculateFactorial(number) {
       if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
           return 1;
       }
       // Continue with other cases
   }
   ```

3. Create a variable to store the result:

   You can create a variable to keep track of the result, initially set to 1 since 1! is 1.

   ```javascript
   function calculateFactorial(number) {
       if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
           return 1;
       }
       let result = 1;
       // Continue with other cases
   }
   ```

4. Use a loop to calculate the factorial:

   For numbers greater than 1, you can use a loop (for or while) to calculate the factorial. Multiply the result by the current number in each iteration and decrement the number until you reach 1.

   ```javascript
   function calculateFactorial(number) {
       if (number === 0 || number === 1) {
           return 1;
       }
       let result = 1;
       for (let i = 2; i <= number; i++) {
           result *= i;
       }
       return result;
   }
   ```

5. Call the function with the desired number:

   To calculate the factorial of a specific number, simply call the `calculateFactorial` function with that number as an argument.

   ```javascript
   const factorialOf5 = calculateFactorial(5);
   console.log(factorialOf5); // Output: 120
   ```

Now, you have a JavaScript function `calculateFactorial` that can calculate the factorial of any positive integer. Just provide the number you want to calculate the factorial for as an argument to this function, and it will return the result.

argument
const queryObj = {...req.query};

The line of code you provided is using the spread syntax in JavaScript to create a new object called queryObj. Let's break it down step by step:

const: This keyword is used to declare a constant variable. A constant is a value that cannot be reassigned once it is defined. In this case, queryObj will be a constant variable.

queryObj: This is the name of the variable being declared. It can be any valid variable name.

=: The equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable. In this case, the value being assigned is the result of the spread syntax operation.

{...req.query}: The spread syntax, represented by the three dots (...), is used to expand an iterable object into individual elements. In this case, the iterable object is req.query, which is typically an object containing key-value pairs representing the query parameters of an HTTP request.

By using the spread syntax, the code is creating a new object and copying all the properties (key-value pairs) from req.query into queryObj. This allows you to have a separate copy of the query parameters in the queryObj variable.

To summarize, the code creates a constant variable queryObj and assigns it a new object that is a copy of req.query, using the spread syntax to expand the properties. This provides a convenient way to manipulate or access the query parameters separately from the original req.query object.
